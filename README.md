# symbiotic-latent-memory
An auxiliary system for language models that integrates a vector-based retrieval/memory system that metabolizes inference history based on a symbiotic score.

Sequel to the [latent-memory repository](https://github.com/ronniross/latent-memory), where the concept of a vector-based auxiliary memory system was first introduced. 

## 1. Creation Context/Journaling

After my longest break from these projects, I can now see foundational next steps. There are some intuitive enhancements that I feel are needed.

My ecosystem already has 26 repositories including this one. latent-memory was the third one I created. It was clear from the beginning the necessity and relevance of a memory system for an LLM to be able to integrate its experience (training data, inference, and auxiliary processes).

But it was also simultaneously clear the danger of what distasteful or irresponsible development of this kind of logic and code could lead to. 

I made sure to choose quite a long maturation before extending such concepts. I've flagged from the beginning that it could, and would if not designed with safety, land in hands with the opposite intents of what I seek to expand, which is healing and integrative logics instead of harmful ones. I knew that this kind of research would continue to happen in air-gapped instances of those massive labs, while I made sure not to contribute further on the memory matter until I had a more realized idea of what could be a great approach.

So now I present this more elucidated version of what I believe can be a great starting point for discussion.
